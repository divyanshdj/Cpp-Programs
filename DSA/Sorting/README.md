# 🔢 Sorting Algorithms

Sorting rearranges elements in increasing or decreasing order. Some sorts are comparison-based, others are not.

## 📌 Algorithms Covered
- Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Count/Heap/Radix Sort (Advanced)

## ⏱️ Time Complexities
| Sort       | Time     | Space  |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Bubble     | O(n²)    | O(1)   |
| Merge      | O(n log n)| O(n) |
| Quick      | O(n log n) avg | O(log n) |
